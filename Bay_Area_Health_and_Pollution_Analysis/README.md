# Bay Area Air Pollution & Health Impact Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **air pollution levels** and **public health impacts** across counties in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
It combines multi-year pollution data with hospital admission records to identify trends and correlations that reveal the environmental health status of the region.

---

#  Objectives
- Clean and merge datasets containing air pollutant measures (PM2.5, Ozone, Diesel PM) and health metrics.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and outliers.
- Visualize correlations between pollution exposure and health outcomes.
- Highlight counties with the highest risk based on combined metrics.

# Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization and trend analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment  

---

##  Key Insights
- PM2.5 and Ozone levels showed the strongest correlation with hospital admissions.  
- Southern Bay Area counties exhibited higher average pollutant levels during dry seasons.  
- Visualization of trends over time revealed increasing Diesel PM during winter months.
